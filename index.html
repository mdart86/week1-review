            <h1>Glasshouse Mountains, Queensland</h1>

        <div class="main-content">
        <p>The 11 gorgeous peaks of the Glass House Mountains are found in the hinterland of Queensland's Sunshine Coast. They are about a one-hour drive south of the Sunshine Coast's main hub, Noosa, or an hour north of the state's capital city, Brisbane. A natural playground of walking tracks, horse trails and abseiling locations, the mountains are also home to six small townships, linked by rail and country roads. You'll also find the incredible Australia Zoo, founded by the famed "Crocodile Hunter", Steve Irwin, and his family.</p>
        <p>The Glass House Mountains are less than a one-hour drive north of Brisbane and about 35 minutes from Sunshine Coast Airport. You can fly into Brisbane from most capital cities, and into the Sunshine Coast from Sydney and Melbourne. You can also get here by train (about 1.25 hours) from Brisbane. The Glass House Mountains offer easy access to many of the Sunshine Coast's major attractions, including the stylish hub of Noosa and Mooloolaba, where you can swim with humpback whales, as well as World Heritage-listed Fraser Island and the so-called "whale watching capital of the world," Hervey Bay.</p>
