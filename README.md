## Create the html
- Build the stucture with DOCTYPE, html tag, head and body. Then, give it a title in the head tag, and start filling up the body, with header (heading), some paragraphs and a link

## Create the css
The best practice is to have an external css file and link it from the html file. We added styling for the the header, h1 and paragraph tags.
